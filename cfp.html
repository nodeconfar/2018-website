                        <p class="pb1">You’re read the Definitive Guide and flicked through the standard, you know how to assign default
                            values with OR and you go to your local usergroup once in a while.</p>
                        <p class="pb1">How do you move your JS skills along and upwards on the unstoppable path of true mastery? Do you

                        <p class="pb1">From the blindingly obvious (write more javascript) - through the positively heretical (never ever
                            use JSLint - except when it’s a really good idea) - to the bizarre (take up needlework), come
                            and be guided toward the bright shiny light where the gods live.</p>

                            <strong>June 19th, 23:59:59 ART (GMT -3).</strong> No excuses.</p>
                        <p class="pb1">Talks can be
                            <strong>in English or Spanish.</strong> Don’t feel pressured to deliver your talk in english if you’re
                            more comfortable speaking in spanish - and vice-versa! Live interpreting services will be available
                            to attendees.</p>
                        <p class="pb1">
                            <strong>Talks are typically 25 minutes long</strong> (for longer talks we’d get in touch with you directly).
                            There is no Q&A. We will be on a tight schedule and enforce the end of a talk rigorously. We
                            suggest timing your presentation in advance.</p>
                        <p class="pb1">
                            <strong>Make sure you care,</strong> and make sure we see you care. Typos, sloppy formatting and all-lowercase
                            submissions make our reading of your proposal tedious. These things will definitely count against
                            your proposal.</p>

                            <strong>Don’t overdo it</strong> either. If you need more than two paragraphs to get to the point of
                            your topic, we need to ask you to slim things down. With the amount of submissions we get, the
                            quicker you can to make a good impression, the better.</p>

                        <p class="pb1">
                            <strong>Original Topics.</strong> One of the things we strive to do with NodeConf Argentina is to push
                            the community forward. We can’t do this if the same people keep talking about the same things
                            all the time. Thus, we favour original content. If you want to discuss a topic that you have
                            talked about elsewhere, try to add a twist, or new research, or development, something unique.
                            Of course, if your talk is plain awesome as-is, go for that :)</p>

                        <p class="pb1">All talks will be recorded and published on the internet for free, along with a recording of the
                            slide deck, live-demo or other on-presenter-screen activity.</p>
                        <p class="pb1">We do this for the benefit of the larger JS community and those who can’t make it to the conference.
                            We hope you want to help out, but if you are in any way uncomfortable in any way, let us know
                            and we will work things out.</p>
